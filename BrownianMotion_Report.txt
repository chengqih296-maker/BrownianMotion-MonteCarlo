Title: Monte Carlo Simulation of 2D Brownian Motion and Diffusion Coefficient Estimation

Abstract:
This project demonstrates a Monte Carlo simulation of 2D Brownian motion to estimate the diffusion coefficient. A Python program generates random trajectories for multiple particles, computes the mean squared displacement (MSD), and estimates the diffusion coefficient using linear regression. The results show good agreement with theoretical predictions.

Introduction:
Brownian motion describes the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, resulting from collisions with surrounding molecules. Understanding diffusion is fundamental in physics, chemistry, and biology. The diffusion coefficient is a key parameter that quantifies how quickly particles spread out over time.

Theory:
In two dimensions, the mean squared displacement (MSD) is related to the diffusion coefficient D by:
MSD = 4Dt
where t is time. By simulating random walks and analyzing the MSD, we can estimate D.

Methodology:
We generate random steps for each particle from a normal distribution with zero mean and variance related to D and time step dt. By accumulating these steps, we obtain 2D trajectories. We simulate 100 particles with 1000 steps each to obtain statistically reliable results.

Results:
The simulation produces realistic Brownian trajectories. The MSD vs. time plot shows a linear trend as expected. Using linear regression, we estimate the slope and calculate the diffusion coefficient for the system. The estimated value closely matches the true input value of D = 1.0.

Discussion:
The slight deviation between the estimated and true D arises from statistical fluctuations and finite sample size. Increasing the number of particles or time steps improves accuracy. The simulation successfully demonstrates the link between random walks and macroscopic diffusion.

Conclusion:
This project illustrates how Monte Carlo methods can be used to study physical processes such as diffusion. The results validate the theoretical MSD relation and provide insight into stochastic processes.
